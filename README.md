# mujiaju_project
This project is a simple and understandable web-project. I offer all the original codes and images just for reference. 
All these executing procedures are described as follows:
1. Download all files in a same folder as a project;
2. Open the project with the VScode on your PC;
3. Run the index.html file with the VScode to watch the whole presentation of the index.html file to see if there are some problems. And you can fine-tune the codes by yourself if you want to make some change about the web effect;
